# feff
Code to compute the efficiency function, $f_eff$ for annihilating/decay dark matter energy injection. This is only the Python implementation of "https://faun.rc.fas.harvard.edu/epsilon/detaileddeposition/annihilation/". If you use this code, you must cite arXiv:1506.03811, and consider to cite also arXiv:1705.00777v1, where it was used for several annihilation chanels.

The necesarry files to run this code are in
https://faun.rc.fas.harvard.edu/epsilon/detaileddeposition/annihilation/
you must either have the files and the code on the same Directory or change it in section II.
